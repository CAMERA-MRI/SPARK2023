# Glioma Segmentation in Resource-Limited Settings
## SAMBA Github

This Github repository serves as the access point to the SPARK Academy SAMBA model from the Wakanda team in the 2023 SPARK Academy. It provides the Code referenced in _[Mohannad Barakat, Noha Magdy et al., Towards SAMBA: Segment Anything Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation in Sub-Sharan African Populations (2023)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11775)

For more information about SPARK, the academy's objectives visit [SPARK's event website](https://event.fourwaves.com/spark). All training events are accessible to registered participants through SPARK's event website.

## About SAMBA:

SAMBA is innovative approach that combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a voting network for multi-modal glioma segmentation. Our fine-tuning strategy, SAM with bounding box-guided prompts (SAMBA), tailors the model to the complexities of African datasets. Leveraging an ensemble strategy with multiple modalities and views, we achieve a robust consensus segmentation that addresses the intra-tumoral heterogeneity.
